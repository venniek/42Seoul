1 Just the other night, i was sitting alone-
2 Staring at the starry sky-
3 Dreaming someone would take away my worries and sadness-
4 Hold me by the hand-
5
6 High up from the sky, with a brilliant light-
7 A spaceship came descending-
8 Someone came out to me and i am sure he was asking-
9 You Can Fly With Me!-
10
11 Never turning back, shot up to the dark and-
12 Feeling the cold air run into my face-
13 Never close your eyes, you're about to see the GALAXY-
14
15 The higher we fly-
16 The deeper we fall-
17 Feeling dizzy with the sound of stars shining LISTEN-
18
19 To the milky way, we were flying away-
20 Through this fascinating darkness-
21 Tried to see and remember, this magical moment-
22 Never to forget-
23
24 Something pulling down, i came back to the ground-
25 I woke up in my own bedroom-
26 But it can't be a dream, cause i still hear him saying-
27 Everything is real!-
28
29 Never turning back, shot up to the dark and-
30 Feeling the cold air run into my face-
31 Never close your eyes, you're about to see the GALAXY-
